            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Aiyan Chowdhury, and I'm a 6th-grade student who enjoys fishing (though I am DEFINITELY not great at it) and coding. I built this site to share my studies and ideas in a fun and interactive way, hoping it will inspire others to learn and explore with me.</p>
            <p>I was lucky to be part of the Gifted and Talented research program, which gave me an opportunity to investigate a subject that I often ponder: homelessness. In this paper, I share some primary research I was able to do by interviewing several experts in the field. It is through this that a deep understanding of homelessness was gathered and helped even more to believe in knowledge to bring about change or meaningful conversations.</p>
            <p>Hopefully, this website will provide an avenue for sharing my learning process and maybe even stir the curiosity of others!</p>
