In this newspaper article, Cline et al. talks about how Liberal Cities are discouraging homelessness in numerous ways. A strength of this source is that it thoroughly explains the activity that these cities have been through. A weakness of this source is that it is a bit vague in some parts.

In this government report, Sousa et al. provides key statistics about homelessness across the United States. A strength of this source is its broad data collection, which makes it useful for understanding national trends. A weakness is that it mostly focuses on reporting numbers without giving solutions.

In this article, Ferrante et al. supports the idea that "Housing First" is the best way to address homelessness. A strength of this source is its focus on a well-known approach, adding credibility.
