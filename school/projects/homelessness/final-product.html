	    <p>If I were to write a letter to an official or a policy maker, I would write something along the lines of this...</p>
            <p>
		Dear *Policy Maker*,
	</br>
		My name is Aiyan, and I am in deep commitment as a student toward raising awareness and finding the solution for homelessness. I am writing to urge you to take meaningful action in making a change in this growing issue within our communities.
</br>
		One of the most important things we can do is commit more resources to housing people can afford. Many homeless people cannot find safe and stable places to live as the cost of housing increases. Providing more units of housing that are affordable, and keeping them affordable, provides a foundation from which people can rebuild their lives.
Equally important is increasing access to mental health services. Many homeless people have extremely high rates of mental health diagnoses, often because of trauma or economic insecurity. Increasing funding for mental health practitioners, adding community mental health centers, and offering care at low or no cost are critical in trying to get to the bottom of homelessness.
Finally, the business community and all other entities that exist within the community may offer additional support. Such things as job training programs, employment, and other initiatives may enable the community to look after themselves while forging friendships within the community. Such initiatives will not only improve life for those directly affected but also the local economy.
</br>
		I pray that these recommendations are taken into consideration, and let's work together as colleagues to implement policies that would bring sustainable change. Together we can make sure that nobody in our society lacks a place to call 'home'.
</br>
</br>
		Thank you for your valuable time and consideration.
</br>
		Sincerely,
</br>
Aiyan Chowdhury
